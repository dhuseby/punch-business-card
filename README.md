# About
This is my design for a business card that is a scaled down version of an old
punchcard.  The included .svg file is an Inkscape file I created that shows
enough examples for you to create your own.  I have included a layer that has a
bitmap of a punch card showing the punches for each character.  You'll notice
that I did not include the X and Y rows of punches in my card.  That is because
I needed to enlarge the text and center it for readability.

You can see what my final business cards look like here: http://bit.ly/1j7MvMI

The font I used for the text is Dotrice from the Open Font Library: https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/dotrice

I used a laser cutter to cut the cards out of manilla card stock.  The
laser registration marks in the .svg file should be printed on the card stock
along with the numbers, your logo, and your details text.  Then when you go
to cut the cards, have the laser go to the corners of the bounds rectangle.
I use a Full Spectrum brand laser cutter which has this feature built-in. YMMV.
I use the registration marks to make sure the laser cuts vector is scaled
correctly and that the laser is lined up with the text printed on the card stock.

If you make your own, it would be nice to send me a tweet with a pic @dwhuseby.

I'd love to see somebody come up with a script of somesort that would take your
information and this .svg file and automate placing the punch cut rectagles for
you.

Cheers!
